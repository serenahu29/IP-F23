My program include hw5.cpp, language_model.h and language_model.cpp files, where hw5.cpp is the main (executable) file, language_model.h declares the functions used and language_model.cpp implements the functions.
There's also a Makefile to help compile, link and execute the program. 

The program allows users to perform operations such as sorting trigrams in ascending or descending order, listing trigrams by count, and finding the most frequently occurring third word in a given trigram.

hw5.cpp is an executable file that takes at least two command-line arguments (a filename and an operation). 
Each time the program is run, hw5.cpp will call the buildModel function to build the trigram-based language model by processing each text file specified in the input filename list.
Depending on the second argument (one of four operations), the file will call specific function to perform operation on the model accordingly.
The output of the program will consist of one trigram with associated count per line (or error messages in some cases).

The language_model.h header file declares the following functions used in the program, while language_model.cpp file defines and implements them:
    void buildModel(std::string filename, std::map<std::string, int>& trigramFrequencies);: Builds a trigram language model from a text file.
    std::string findThirdWord(const std::string& word1, const std::string& word2, const std::map<std::string, int>& trigramFrequencies);: Determines the most occurring next word after word1 and word2. This operation requires two additional command-line arguments to specify the first and second words of the trigram.
    void listAscendingAlphabeticalTrigrams(const std::map<std::string, int>& trigramFrequencies);: Lists trigrams in ascending alphabetical order.
    void listDescendingAlphabeticalTrigrams(const std::map<std::string, int>& trigramFrequencies);: Lists trigrams in descending alphabetical order.
    void listCountOrderedTrigrams(const std::map<std::string, int>& trigramFrequencies);: Lists trigrams in decreasing order by count.
